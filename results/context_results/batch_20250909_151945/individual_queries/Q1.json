      "answer": "Based on the search results, the compliance requirements for using AI in hiring across NYC, California, and Illinois are as follows:\n\n**New York City (NYC)**\n\nNYC Local Law 144 requires employers to conduct a bias audit of their AI hiring tools to ensure they do not discriminate against protected classes [1]. The law also requires employers to provide notice to applicants and employees about the use of AI in the hiring process.\n\n**California**\n\nCalifornia has set new standards for AI use in employment, including a requirement that employers use AI tools that are designed to prevent bias and ensure equal employment opportunities [2]. California SB 7 also requires employers to provide notice to applicants and employees about the use of AI in the hiring process and to disclose the use of AI in background checks [7].\n\n**Illinois**\n\nIllinois has joined Colorado and NYC in restricting the use of generative AI in HR, including AI hiring tools [10]. The law requires employers to conduct a bias audit of their AI hiring tools and to provide notice to applicants and employees about the use of AI in the hiring process.\n\n**Best Practices**\n\nTo mitigate the risk of AI hiring tool noncompliance with antidiscrimination statutes, employers should follow best practices such as:\n\n* Conducting regular bias audits of AI hiring tools [4]\n* Using AI tools that are designed to prevent bias and ensure equal employment opportunities [2]\n* Providing notice to applicants and employees about the use of AI in the hiring process [1, 2, 7]\n* Disclosing the use of AI in background checks [7]\n* Ensuring that AI hiring tools are transparent and explainable [8]\n\n**Regulatory Landscape**\n\nThe regulatory landscape for AI in hiring is rapidly evolving, with new laws and regulations being enacted at the state and local level [5, 9]. Employers should stay up-to-date on the latest developments and ensure that their AI hiring tools comply with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\nIn conclusion, the compliance requirements for using AI in hiring across NYC, California, and Illinois are complex and multifaceted. Employers must conduct regular bias audits, use AI tools that are designed to prevent bias, provide notice to applicants and employees, and disclose the use of AI in background checks. By following best practices and staying up-to-date on the latest regulatory developments, employers can ensure that their AI hiring tools comply with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] NYC Local Law 144 and Bias Audit Regulation\n[2",

Enforcement of this law began on July 5, 2023 [3]. Additionally, NYC has provided guidance on the use of AI in hiring, which includes requirements for bias audits and testing [4].\n\n**California**\n\nCalifornia has enacted a law, Assembly Bill 2282, which requires employers to disclose the use of automated employment decision tools (AE DTs) in hiring decisions [5]. The law also requires employers to provide a way for applicants to request an explanation of the AE DT decision-making process.\n\n**Illinois**\n\nIllinois has joined Colorado and NYC in restricting the use of generative AI in HR [1]. However, the specific compliance requirements for Illinois are not explicitly stated in the search results.\n\n**General Requirements**\n\nThe use of AI in hiring is subject to various federal and state laws, including the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidelines on AI and employment [6]. Employers must ensure that their AI systems are fair, transparent, and unbiased, and that they comply with applicable laws and regulations.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nTo comply with the compliance requirements for using AI in hiring across NYC, California, and Illinois, employers should:\n\n1. Disclose the use of AI in hiring decisions and provide a way for applicants to request an explanation of the AI decision-making process [3, 5].\n2. Conduct bias audits and testing to ensure that AI systems are fair and unbiased [4, 10].\n3.

AEDTs are defined as \"any algorithm or computational process, including but not limited to, machine learning, natural language processing, or predictive analytics, that is used to evaluate a candidate's qualifications, skills, or other characteristics for employment purposes\" [10]. Employers using AEDTs in NYC must provide candidates with a clear and concise disclosure of the use of AEDTs, including the type of AEDT used, the data used to train the AEDT, and the criteria used to evaluate candidates [10]. Additionally, employers must provide candidates with the opportunity to opt-out of the AEDT process and have their application reviewed by a human [10].\n\n**California**\n\nCalifornia has enacted a law regulating the use of AI in hiring, specifically the use of AEDTs. The law requires employers to disclose to candidates that an AEDT is being used in the hiring process and to provide candidates with information about the AEDT, including the data used to train the AEDT and the criteria used to evaluate candidates [4]. Additionally, California has established a new standard for AI use in employment, which requires employers to ensure that AI systems are fair, transparent, and unbiased [4].\n\n**Illinois**\n\nIllinois has enacted a law regulating the use of AI in hiring, specifically the use of AEDTs. The law requires employers to disclose to candidates that an AEDT is being used in the hiring process and to provide candidates with information about the AEDT, including the data used to train the AEDT and the criteria used to evaluate candidates [1].

      "answer": "Based on the search results, the compliance requirements for using AI in hiring across NYC, California, and Illinois are as follows:\n\n**New York City (NYC)**\n\nNYC's Local Law 144, also known as the Automated Employment Decision Tools Law, regulates the use of AI in hiring and promotion decisions. The law requires employers to:\n\n1. Provide notice to applicants and employees that AI is being used in the hiring process [9].\n2. Conduct bias audits on AI-driven hiring tools to ensure they are fair and unbiased [6].\n3. Implement procedures to address and mitigate bias in AI-driven hiring tools [10].\n4. Ensure that AI-driven hiring tools are transparent and explainable [1].\n5. Comply with the NYC Human Rights Law, which prohibits discriminatory practices in employment [2].\n\nThe final regulations on the use of AI in hiring and promotion were adopted by the NYC Commission on Human Rights in 2023, and the enforcement date was extended to July 5, 2023 [3].\n\n**California**\n\nCalifornia has not enacted a specific law regulating the use of AI in hiring, but employers must comply with the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), which prohibits discriminatory practices in employment [not mentioned in the search results].\n\n**Illinois**\n\nIllinois has not enacted a specific law regulating the use of AI in hiring, but employers must comply with the Illinois Human Rights Act, which prohibits discriminatory practices in employment [not mentioned in the search results].\n\nIn summary, while there is no specific law regulating the use of AI in hiring in California and Illinois, employers in these states must still comply with federal and state anti-discrimination laws. In contrast, NYC's Local Law 144 provides specific requirements for the use of AI in hiring and promotion decisions.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Dorf Nelson & Zauderer LLP, \"Use of AI in HR - NY City Law 144\" (2024)\n[2] National Law Review, \"NYC's Local Law 144 and Final Regulations: Regulation of AI-Driven Hiring Tools in the United States\" (2025)\n[3] Littler, \"New York City Adopts Final Regulations on Use of AI in Hiring and Promotion, Extends Enforcement Date to July 5, 2023\" (2023)\n[6] EtiCAS AI, \"Lessons from Automating Bias Detection in AI Hiring Systems for NYC Law 144 Compliance\" (2024)\n[9] Crown",

Employers should stay up-to-date on the latest developments and ensure that their AI hiring tools comply with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\nIn conclusion, the compliance requirements for using AI in hiring across NYC, California, and Illinois are complex and multifaceted. Employers must conduct regular bias audits, use AI tools that are designed to prevent bias, provide notice to applicants and employees, and disclose the use of AI in background checks. By following best practices and staying up-to-date on the latest regulatory developments, employers can ensure that their AI hiring tools comply with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] NYC Local Law 144 and Bias Audit Regulation\n[2",
