      "answer": "Based on the search results provided, here is a comprehensive answer to the legal question:\n\n**Compliance Requirements for Using AI in Hiring across NYC, California, and Illinois**\n\nThe use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in hiring practices has become increasingly prevalent, but it also raises concerns about bias, transparency, and compliance with antidiscrimination laws. The following are the key compliance requirements for using AI in hiring across NYC, California, and Illinois:\n\n**New York City (NYC)**\n\n* Local Law 144, enacted in 2023, requires employers to ensure that automated employment decision tools (AEDTs) used in hiring practices are fair and transparent [1].\n* Employers must also provide notice to applicants about the use of AEDTs and allow them to opt-out if they choose to do so [1].\n\n**California**\n\n* California has set new standards for AI use in employment, requiring employers to ensure that AI-driven decisions are fair and unbiased [5].\n* The state's SB 7 law, enacted in 2025, regulates the use of AI in hiring practices, including background checks [7].\n* Employers must also provide notice to applicants about the use of AI in hiring practices and allow them to opt-out if they choose to do so [5].\n\n**Illinois**\n\n* There are no specific laws or regulations governing the use of AI in hiring practices in Illinois.\n* However, employers must still comply with federal antidiscrimination laws, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and ensure that their AI-driven decisions are fair and unbiased.\n\n**Federal Law**\n\n* The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has issued guidelines on the use of AI in hiring practices, emphasizing the need for employers to ensure that AI-driven decisions are fair and unbiased [2].\n* Employers must also comply with federal antidiscrimination laws, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\n**Best Practices**\n\n* To mitigate the risk of noncompliance with antidiscrimination statutes, employers should follow best practices, including:\n\t+ Conducting regular audits to ensure that AI-driven decisions are fair and unbiased [2].\n\t+ Providing notice to applicants about the use of AI in hiring practices and allowing them to opt-out if they choose to do so [1, 5].\n\t+ Ensuring that AI-driven decisions are transparent and explainable [9].\n\nIn conclusion, employers using AI in hiring practices across NYC, California, and Illinois must comply",

In response to these concerns, several states and cities have enacted laws regulating the use of AI in employment decisions.\n\n**New York City (NYC)**\n\nIn NYC, Local Law 144 requires employers to conduct independent audits of automated employment decision tools (AE DTs) every two years [3], [4]. The law defines AE DTs as \"any algorithm or data-driven tool used by an employer to make a decision about an individual's employment\" [5]. Employers must also provide notice to applicants and employees before using AI in hiring decisions [9].\n\n**California**\n\nIn California, the draft regulations for automated employment decision tools would require pre-use notice to applicants and employees before employers use AI in hiring decisions [9]. However, it is unclear when these regulations will be finalized.\n\n**Illinois**\n\nIllinois has joined Colorado and NYC in restricting generative AI in HR processes [1].

Here's a breakdown of the specific requirements in NYC, California, and Illinois:\n\n1. **New York City (NYC)**:\n\t* Local Law 144 requires employers to keep records of any systems or applications used in hiring and promotion processes [2].\n\t* Employers must have an independent auditor review their AI tools for bias and discrimination before using them for hiring or promotions [8, 9].\n\t* The NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) issued a Notice of Adoption of Final Rule to implement Local Law 144 on April 6, 2023 [9].\n2. **California**:\n\t* Starting October 1, 2025, California will enforce new regulations governing Automated Decision-Making Systems (ADS) used in employment settings [4].\n\t* The \"Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act\" requires hiring organizations to take multiple steps before using AI to evaluate candidates, including conducting a bias audit and implementing measures to mitigate bias [3].\n3. **Illinois**:\n\t* On August 9, 2024, Gov. Pritzker signed HB 3773, making it unlawful for employers to use AI that has the effect of discriminating against employees or applicants [1].\n\nIn summary, employers using AI in hiring processes must comply with the following requirements:\n\n* Maintain records of AI tools used in hiring and promotion processes (NYC)\n* Conduct bias audits and implement measures to mitigate bias before using AI tools for hiring or promotions (CA)\n* Ensure that AI tools do not discriminate against employees or applicants (IL)\n\nEmployers should also be aware of the growing patchwork of employment laws and regulations regarding AI use in the workplace [6, 7]. It is essential to consult with legal experts to ensure compliance with these requirements.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] The Employer Report: Illinois Joins Colorado and NYC in Restricting Generative AI in HR\n[2] Purdue Global Law School Blog: Automated Employment Decision Tools in the Crosshairs\n[3] Sense HQ Blog: AI Recruiting & Hiring Laws\n[4] Nixon Peabody Alert: California sets new standards for AI use in employment\n[5] Fisher Phillips Insight: Comprehensive Review",

Specifically, this answer will focus on the compliance requirements for using AI in hiring in New York City (NYC), California, and Illinois.\n\n**New York City (NYC)**\n\nIn NYC, Local Law 144 regulates the use of Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDTs) in hiring practices [5]. The law requires employers to:\n\n1. Conduct a bias audit on AEDTs within one year of their use [5];\n2. Make information about the bias audit publicly available [5]; and\n3. Provide notice to candidates that an AEDT was used in the hiring process [5].\n\nThe NYC Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) has issued regulations implementing Local Law 144, which include a penalty schedule for non-compliance [8]. Employers must also ensure that AEDTs are transparent and fair, and provide opportunities for human review and oversight [1], [2], [3].\n\n**California**\n\nWhile California does not have specific laws regulating the use of AI in hiring, there is a proposed regulation regarding Automated-Decision Systems (ADS) [9]. The proposed regulation would require employers to:\n\n1. Conduct regular audits on ADSs;\n2. Provide notice to candidates that an ADS was used in the hiring process; and\n3. Ensure that ADSs are transparent and fair.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that this proposed regulation has not yet been finalized [9].\n\n**Illinois**\n\nIn Illinois, the Automated Decision Tools Act regulates the use of AEDTs in hiring practices [7].
