        "answer": "Based on the search results, the compliance requirements for using AI in hiring across NYC, California, and Illinois are as follows:\n\n**New York City (NYC)**\n\nNYC's Local Law 144, enacted in 2021, requires employers to ensure that automated employment decision tools (AEDTs) used in hiring processes are fair and transparent [1, 2, 3, 9]. The law applies to employers with 15 or more employees and requires them to:\n\n1. Conduct regular audits of AEDTs to ensure they are fair and unbiased [1, 9].\n2. Provide clear explanations of the decision-making process used by AEDTs [1, 9].\n3. Ensure that AEDTs do not discriminate against protected classes, such as age, sex, or disability [1, 9].\n\nEmployers who fail to comply with Local Law 144 may face fines and reputational damage [1].\n\n**California**\n\nCalifornia's SB 7, enacted in 2022, requires employers to ensure that AI-powered hiring tools are fair and unbiased [6]. The law applies to employers with 5 or more employees and requires them to:\n\n1. Conduct regular audits of AI-powered hiring tools to ensure they are fair and unbiased [6].\n2. Provide clear explanations of the decision-making process used by AI-powered hiring tools [6].\n3. Ensure that AI-powered hiring tools do not discriminate against protected classes, such as age, sex, or disability [6].\n\nEmployers who fail to comply with SB 7 may face fines and reputational damage [6].\n\n**Illinois**\n\nThere is no specific law or regulation in Illinois that addresses AI-powered hiring tools. However, employers in Illinois are still subject to federal and state anti-discrimination laws, including the Illinois Human Rights Act [5].\n\n**Best Practices**\n\nTo mitigate the risk of AI hiring tool noncompliance with antidiscrimination statutes, employers should:\n\n1. Conduct regular audits of AI-powered hiring tools to ensure they are fair and unbiased [7].\n2. Provide clear explanations of the decision-making process used by AI-powered hiring tools [7].\n3. Ensure that AI-powered hiring tools do not discriminate against protected classes, such as age, sex, or disability [7].\n4. Implement bias-mitigation strategies, such as data validation and testing [7].\n\nIn conclusion, employers using AI in hiring across NYC, California, and Illinois must ensure that their AI-powered hiring tools are fair,",
