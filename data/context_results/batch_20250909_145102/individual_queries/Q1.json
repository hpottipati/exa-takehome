      "answer": "The compliance requirements for using AI in hiring across NYC, California, and Illinois are as follows:\n\n**New York City (NYC)**\n\nNYC's Local Law 144, enacted in 2021, regulates the use of Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDTs) in hiring processes. AEDTs are defined as \"any algorithm or computational method used to evaluate a candidate's qualifications, skills, or other characteristics\" [4]. To comply with Local Law 144, employers must:\n\n1. Provide clear and conspicuous notice to applicants that an AEDT will be used in the hiring process [4].\n2. Ensure that AEDTs are fair and unbiased, and do not discriminate against protected classes [4].\n3. Conduct regular audits to detect and prevent bias in AEDTs [4].\n4. Make available to applicants and employees the data and procedures used to make employment decisions [4].\n\nEmployers who fail to comply with Local Law 144 may face fines and reputational damage [4].\n\n**California**\n\nIn July 2025, California set new standards for AI use in employment, requiring employers to:\n\n1. Ensure that AI systems used in hiring processes are fair and unbiased [2].\n2. Provide clear and conspicuous notice to applicants that an AI system will be used in the hiring process [2].\n3. Conduct regular audits to detect and prevent bias in AI systems [2].\n4. Make available to applicants and employees the data and procedures used to make employment decisions [2].\n\nCalifornia's new standards for AI use in employment are set forth in the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing's (DFEH) guidelines [2].\n\n**Illinois**\n\nIllinois has not enacted specific regulations governing the use of AI in hiring processes. However, employers in Illinois are still subject to federal and state anti-discrimination laws, including the Illinois Human Rights Act [9].\n\n**Federal Law**\n\nThe federal government has not enacted specific regulations governing the use of AI in hiring processes. However, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has issued guidelines on the use of AI in employment decisions, emphasizing the need for employers to ensure that AI systems are fair and unbiased [3].\n\nIn conclusion, employers using AI in hiring processes in NYC, California, and Illinois must comply with the following requirements:\n\n* Provide clear and conspicuous notice to applicants that an AEDT or AI system will be used in the hiring process.\n* Ensure that AEDTs and AI systems are fair and unbiased",

Employers must ensure that their AI systems do not perpetuate bias and are transparent in their decision-making processes [3]. The law requires employers to conduct regular bias audits and provide training to employees on AI bias [10]. Enforcement of the law began on July 5, 2023 [3].\n\n**California**\n\nCalifornia has not implemented a specific law regulating AI in hiring, but it has enacted a law requiring employers to disclose the use of automated employment decision tools (AE DTs) to applicants and employees [5]. Employers must provide a clear and concise disclosure statement, including information about the AE DT's decision-making process and the potential for bias [5].\n\n**Illinois**\n\nIllinois has joined Colorado and NYC in restricting the use of generative AI in HR [1]. The law requires employers to ensure that their AI systems do not perpetuate bias and are transparent in their decision-making processes. Employers must also conduct regular bias audits and provide training to employees on AI bias [1].\n\n**Common Requirements**\n\nAcross all three jurisdictions, employers must ensure that their AI systems are fair, transparent, and unbiased. This includes:\n\n1. Conducting regular bias audits to identify and mitigate potential biases in AI decision-making processes [1, 10].\n2. Providing training to employees on AI bias and ensuring that they understand the potential risks and consequences of biased AI systems [1, 10].\n3. Ensuring that AI systems are transparent in their decision-making processes and provide clear explanations for their decisions [3, 5].\n4. Disclosing the use of AE DTs to applicants and employees, including information about the AE DT's decision-making process and the potential for bias [5].\n\n**Statutes and Regulations**\n\n* NYC Local Law 144 [3]\n* California Labor Code \u00a7 1102.6 [5]\n* Illinois law restricting generative AI in HR [1]\n\n**Case Law**\n\nNo specific case law was mentioned in the search results.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nEmployers using AI in hiring across NYC, California, and Illinois must ensure that their AI systems are fair, transparent, and unbiased. This includes conducting regular bias audits, providing training to employees on AI bias, ensuring transparency in AI decision",

      "answer": "Based on the search results, the compliance requirements for using AI in hiring across NYC, California, and Illinois are as follows:\n\n**New York City (NYC)**\n\nNYC has enacted a law regulating the use of Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDTs) in hiring. AEDTs are defined as \"any algorithmic tool or software that is used to evaluate a candidate's qualifications, skills, or other characteristics for employment purposes\" [10]. Employers using AEDTs in NYC must provide a clear and concise disclosure to job applicants, including information about the AEDT's decision-making process and the factors used to evaluate candidates [10]. Additionally, employers must provide applicants with the opportunity to request an explanation of the AEDT's decision and to appeal the decision [10].\n\n**California**\n\nCalifornia has enacted a law regulating the use of AI in employment, specifically in the context of hiring and promotion decisions. The law requires employers to disclose the use of AI in hiring and promotion decisions and to provide applicants with information about the factors used to evaluate candidates [4]. Employers must also provide applicants with the opportunity to request an explanation of the AI's decision and to appeal the decision [4]. Furthermore, California has established a new standard for AI use in employment, which requires employers to ensure that AI systems are fair, transparent, and unbiased [4].\n\n**Illinois**\n\nIllinois has joined Colorado and NYC in restricting the use of generative AI in HR. The law prohibits employers from using generative AI in hiring decisions unless the AI system is designed to mitigate bias and ensure fairness [1]. Employers must also provide a clear and concise disclosure to job applicants about the use of generative AI in hiring decisions and provide applicants with the opportunity to request an explanation of the AI's decision and to appeal the decision [1].\n\n**Common Requirements**\n\nAcross all three jurisdictions, employers using AI in hiring must ensure that their AI systems are fair, transparent, and unbiased.

      "answer": "The compliance requirements for using AI in hiring across NYC, California, and Illinois are as follows:\n\n**New York City (NYC)**\n\nNYC's Local Law 144, enacted in 2021, regulates the use of Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDTs) in hiring and promotion decisions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. AEDTs are defined as tools that use machine learning or other forms of artificial intelligence to evaluate job applicants or employees [1]. The law requires employers to:\n\n1. Provide notice to job applicants that an AEDT will be used in the hiring process [9].\n2. Conduct regular bias audits of AEDTs to ensure they are fair and unbiased [6, 7].\n3. Implement procedures to address and mitigate bias in AEDTs [5, 8].\n4. Maintain records of AEDT use and bias audits [4].\n\nThe law also requires employers to provide a clear and concise explanation of the AEDT's decision-making process and the factors considered in making hiring decisions [9].\n\n**California**\n\nCalifornia has not enacted a specific law regulating AI in hiring, but employers are subject to the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), which prohibits employment discrimination based on various protected characteristics, including age, disability, and sex [10]. Employers using AI in hiring must ensure that their tools do not perpetuate or exacerbate existing biases and that they comply with FEHA's anti-discrimination provisions.\n\n**Illinois**\n\nIllinois has enacted the Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act, which regulates the use of AI-powered video interviews in hiring decisions [10]. The law requires employers to provide notice to job applicants that an AI-powered video interview will be used and to ensure that the tool is fair and unbiased.\n\nIn summary, while NYC has a comprehensive law regulating AI in hiring, California and Illinois have more limited regulations. Employers using AI in hiring across these jurisdictions must ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, including conducting bias audits, providing notice to job applicants, and implementing procedures to address and mitigate bias in AEDTs.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Dorf Nelson & Zauderer LLP, \"Use of AI in HR - NY City Law 144\" (2024)\n[2] National Law Review, \"NYC's Local Law 144 and Final Regulations: Regulation of AI-Driven Hiring Tools in the",

AEDTs are defined as \"any algorithm or computational method used to evaluate a candidate's qualifications, skills, or other characteristics\" [4]. To comply with Local Law 144, employers must:\n\n1. Provide clear and conspicuous notice to applicants that an AEDT will be used in the hiring process [4].\n2. Ensure that AEDTs are fair and unbiased, and do not discriminate against protected classes [4].\n3. Conduct regular audits to detect and prevent bias in AEDTs [4].\n4. Make available to applicants and employees the data and procedures used to make employment decisions [4].\n\nEmployers who fail to comply with Local Law 144 may face fines and reputational damage [4].\n\n**California**\n\nIn July 2025, California set new standards for AI use in employment, requiring employers to:\n\n1. Ensure that AI systems used in hiring processes are fair and unbiased [2].\n2. Provide clear and conspicuous notice to applicants that an AI system will be used in the hiring process [2].\n3.

      "answer_a": "The compliance requirements for using AI in hiring across NYC, California, and Illinois are as follows:\n\n**New York City (NYC)**\n\nNYC's Local Law 144, enacted in 2021, regulates the use of Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDTs) in hiring and promotion decisions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. AEDTs are defined as tools that use machine learning or other forms of artificial intelligence to evaluate job applicants or employees [1]. The law requires employers to:\n\n1. Provide notice to job applicants that an AEDT will be used in the hiring process [9].\n2. Conduct regular bias audits of AEDTs to ensure they are fair and unbiased [6, 7].\n3. Implement procedures to address and mitigate bias in AEDTs [5, 8].\n4. Maintain records of AEDT use and bias audits [4].\n\nThe law also requires employers to provide a clear and concise explanation of the AEDT's decision-making process and the factors considered in making hiring decisions [9].\n\n**California**\n\nCalifornia has not enacted a specific law regulating AI in hiring, but employers are subject to the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), which prohibits employment discrimination based on various protected characteristics, including age, disability, and sex [10]. Employers using AI in hiring must ensure that their tools do not perpetuate or exacerbate existing biases and that they comply with FEHA's anti-discrimination provisions.\n\n**Illinois**\n\nIllinois has enacted the Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act, which regulates the use of AI-powered video interviews in hiring decisions [10]. The law requires employers to provide notice to job applicants that an AI-powered video interview will be used and to ensure that the tool is fair and unbiased.\n\nIn summary, while NYC has a comprehensive law regulating AI in hiring, California and Illinois have more limited regulations. Employers using AI in hiring across these jurisdictions must ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, including conducting bias audits, providing notice to job applicants, and implementing procedures to address and mitigate bias in AEDTs.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Dorf Nelson & Zauderer LLP, \"Use of AI in HR - NY City Law 144\" (2024)\n[2] National Law Review, \"NYC's Local Law 144 and Final Regulations: Regulation of AI-Driven Hiring Tools in the",
