      "answer": "Based on the search results, the foreign investment notification requirements under CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) for a Chinese technology company acquiring a US AI startup are as follows:\n\n**Background**\n\nThe US government has implemented new regulations to control outbound investments, particularly in sensitive technologies such as AI, quantum computing, and semiconductors. These regulations aim to prevent the transfer of sensitive technologies to countries of concern, including China.\n\n**CFIUS Review Process**\n\nUnder the CFIUS review process, foreign investments in US companies, including those in the AI sector, are subject to review and approval. The CFIUS review process involves a thorough examination of the investment to determine whether it poses a risk to national security.\n\n**Outbound Investment Security Program**\n\nThe Outbound Investment Security Program, implemented on January 2, 2025, requires US investors to obtain approval from the Department of the Treasury before investing in certain advanced electronic technologies in China or Chinese-owned companies. This program targets investments in AI, quantum computing, and semiconductors, among other sensitive technologies.\n\n**Notification Requirements**\n\nTo comply with the CFIUS review process and the Outbound Investment Security Program, a Chinese technology company acquiring a US AI startup must notify CFIUS of the proposed investment. The notification must include detailed information about the investment, including:\n\n* The identity of the foreign investor and the US company\n* The nature and scope of the investment\n* The potential risks to national security\n* Any measures to mitigate those risks\n\n**Due Diligence and Reporting Requirements**\n\nThe Chinese technology company must also conduct thorough due diligence on the US AI startup and report any findings to CFIUS. This includes reviewing the company's technology, intellectual property, and business practices to ensure that they do not pose a risk to national security.\n\n**Executive Order 14105**\n\nExecutive Order 14105, issued on July 21, 2025, requires Chinese owners to divest from US technology companies that pose a risk to national security. This order applies to investments in AI, quantum computing, and semiconductors, among other sensitive technologies.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, a Chinese technology company acquiring a US AI startup must comply with the CFIUS review process and the Outbound Investment Security Program. This includes notifying CFIUS of the proposed investment, conducting thorough due diligence, and reporting any findings to CFIUS. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in the denial",

      "answer": "Based on the search results, the foreign investment notification requirements under the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) for a Chinese technology company acquiring a US AI startup are as follows:\n\n1. **Mandatory Notification**: A mandatory notification to CFIUS may be required for certain types of foreign investments into US businesses that produce, design, test, manufacture, or use \"emerging and foundational technologies\" (EFTs), which include AI [10]. The CFIUS regulations define EFTs as technologies that are critical to the national security of the United States, including AI, robotics, and biotechnology [10].\n2. **Fast-Track Review**: In June 2025, the US Department of the Treasury introduced a fast-track review process for foreign investors, including those from China, to facilitate the review of certain transactions [1]. This fast-track review process may be available for transactions that do not raise national security concerns.\n3. **Outbound Investment Screening Rule**: In January 2025, the US government introduced an outbound investment screening rule, which targets US investment in Chinese or Chinese-owned companies [9]. This rule requires US investors to notify the US government before making investments in certain Chinese companies.\n4. **Executive Order**: In July 2025, an executive order was issued requiring Chinese owners to divest from US technology companies that produce, design, test, manufacture, or use EFTs [7]. This executive order may apply to the Chinese technology company acquiring a US AI startup.\n5. **CFIUS Non-Notified Transaction Enforcement**: CFIUS has been actively enforcing non-notified transactions, and companies that fail to notify CFIUS may face penalties and fines [6].\n\nIn summary, a Chinese technology company acquiring a US AI startup may be required to notify CFIUS under the CFIUS regulations, and the transaction may be subject to a mandatory review process. The company should also consider the fast-track review process, the outbound investment screening rule, and the executive order requiring Chinese owners to divest from US technology companies.\n\n**Relevant Statutes and Regulations:**\n\n* The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) regulations, 31 CFR Part 800\n* The Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007 (FINSA)\n* The Executive Order on Addressing the Threat Posed by Applications and Other Software Developed or Controlled by Chinese Companies (July 2025)\n\n**References",

CFIUS is responsible for addressing the potential national security impacts of foreign direct investment in the United States [6].\n\n**Notification Requirements**\n\nTo notify CFIUS, the Chinese technology company must submit a voluntary notice to the Committee, which includes information about the transaction, such as the identity of the parties involved, the nature of the investment, and the potential national security implications [3]. The notice must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the closing of the transaction [3].\n\n**Thresholds for Notification**\n\nCFIUS has established thresholds for notification, which include:\n\n* The transaction involves a foreign person acquiring control of a US business that produces or develops critical technologies, including AI [8].\n* The transaction involves a foreign person acquiring control of a US business that has access to sensitive information, including AI-related data [8].\n\n**Review Process**\n\nOnce the notice is submitted, CFIUS will review the transaction to determine whether it poses a national security risk [5]. The review process typically takes 30 days, but can be extended up to 45 days in complex cases [3].\n\n**Penalties for Non-Compliance**\n\n Failure to notify CFIUS or providing false or incomplete information can result in penalties, including fines and imprisonment [9].\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\nIn 2024, CFIUS extended its reach, reviewing more transactions than ever before, and imposing more stringent requirements on foreign investors [9]. The 2024 CFIUS Annual Report highlights the Committee's efforts to address national security risks associated with foreign investment in the United States [8].\n\nIn conclusion, a Chinese technology company acquiring a US AI startup must notify CFIUS at least 30 days prior to the closing of the transaction, providing information about the transaction, including the identity of the parties involved, the nature of the investment, and the potential national security implications. Failure to notify CFIUS or providing false or incomplete information can result in penalties.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) | U.S. Department of",

CFIUS is responsible for addressing the potential national security impacts of foreign direct investment in the United States [6].\n\n**Notification Requirements**\n\nTo notify CFIUS, the Chinese technology company must submit a voluntary notice to the Committee, which includes information about the transaction, such as the identity of the parties involved, the nature of the investment, and the potential national security implications [3]. The notice must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the closing of the transaction [3].\n\n**Thresholds for Notification**\n\nCFIUS has established thresholds for notification, which include:\n\n* The transaction involves a foreign person acquiring control of a US business that produces or develops critical technologies, including AI [8].\n* The transaction involves a foreign person acquiring control of a US business that has access to sensitive information, including AI-related data [8].\n\n**Review Process**\n\nOnce the notice is submitted, CFIUS will review the transaction to determine whether it poses a national security risk [5]. The review process typically takes 30 days, but can be extended up to 45 days in complex cases [3].\n\n**Penalties for Non-Compliance**\n\n Failure to notify CFIUS or providing false or incomplete information can result in penalties, including fines and imprisonment [9].\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\nIn 2024, CFIUS extended its reach, reviewing more transactions than ever before, and imposing more stringent requirements on foreign investors [9]. The 2024 CFIUS Annual Report highlights the Committee's efforts to address national security risks associated with foreign investment in the United States [8].\n\nIn conclusion, a Chinese technology company acquiring a US AI startup must notify CFIUS at least 30 days prior to the closing of the transaction, providing information about the transaction, including the identity of the parties involved, the nature of the investment, and the potential national security implications. Failure to notify CFIUS or providing false or incomplete information can result in penalties.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) | U.S. Department of",
