The notification must include:\n\t* A description of the breach, including the date of the breach and the date of discovery [2, 3].\n\t* A description of the types of personal information that were compromised [2, 3].\n\t* A statement that the individual's SSN and medical information may have been compromised [2, 3].\n\t* A statement that the individual can obtain a free credit report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies [2, 3].\n\t* A statement that the individual can obtain information about the breach from the affected entity [2, 3].\n3. **Notification to the California Department of Public Health**: If the breach involves medical information, the affected entity must also notify the California Department of Public Health within 10 business days of discovering the breach [4, 8].\n\nAs for the penalties for non-compliance, the California Department of Public Health may impose administrative penalties of up to $250,000 for each violation [4, 8]. Additionally, the affected entity may be liable for civil penalties of up to $7,500 per violation, as well as attorneys' fees and costs [2, 3].\n\nIt's worth noting that California's data breach notification law is in addition to federal HIPAA regulations, which also apply to healthcare providers and other covered entities [6]. The California Department of Public Health has issued regulations implementing the state's data breach notification law, which can be found in the California Code of Regulations, Title 17, Section 2500 et seq. [8].\n\nIn summary, the notification requirements for a data breach involving both SSNs and medical information in California are complex and require timely notification to the California Attorney General, affected individuals, and the California Department of Public Health. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in significant penalties.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] California Civil Code Section 1798.82\n[2] California",
