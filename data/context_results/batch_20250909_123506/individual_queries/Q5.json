      "answer": "To address the legal question regarding notification requirements for a data breach involving both Social Security Numbers (SSNs) and medical information in California, as well as penalties for non-compliance, we need to analyze the available resources.\n\n### Notification Requirements\n\nCalifornia has specific laws that govern data breaches. The primary law is the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which requires companies to notify affected individuals of a breach within 30 days if personal information is compromised. However, this does not specifically address medical information or SSNs.\n\nFor medical information and SSNs, the **California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA)** provides additional protections. CMIA mandates that healthcare providers must notify patients when there has been a breach involving Protected Health Information (PHI), which includes SSNs in some cases [1].\n\nIn California, if both personal information such as SSNs and medical information are compromised in a data breach, the notification requirements would likely be governed by both CCPA and CMIA. Therefore, companies should notify affected individuals within 30 days of discovering the breach under CCPA guidelines, but they must also comply with CMIA's specific provisions for notifying patients about breaches involving PHI.\n\n### Penalties for Non-Compliance\n\nPenalties for non-compliance can vary significantly depending on the severity and nature of the violation. The **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** imposes penalties for violations, including fines up to $7,500 per violation [2]. However, these penalties are typically applied in cases where there is a failure to comply with CCPA requirements.\n\nFor HIPAA violations, which often involve breaches of PHI, the **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)** imposes substantial penalties. These can include fines up to $1.5 million per violation [3]. Additionally, HIPAA requires companies to notify affected individuals within 60 days of discovering a breach involving PHI.\n\nIn cases where both CCPA and HIPAA are implicated, the more severe penalty would typically apply. For example, if there is a failure to comply with CMIA's notification requirements for breaches involving medical information, the company could face penalties under CMIA [4].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor a data breach involving both SSNs and medical information in California:\n- **Notification Requirements**: Companies must notify affected individuals within 30 days of discovering the breach under CCPA guidelines. However, they must also comply with CMIA's specific provisions for notifying patients about breaches involving PHI.\n- **Pen",

Here is a comprehensive answer based on the provided search results:\n\n### Notification Requirements\n\n#### 1. **Data Security Breach Reporting | State of California - Department of Justice**\n[1] The Data Security Breach Reporting law requires any person or business that is required to issue a security breach notification to more than 500 California residents as a result of a single breach of the security system to electronically submit a single sample copy of that security breach notification, excluding any personally identifiable information (PII), to the Attorney General. This submission must be made within 45 days after becoming aware of the breach.\n\n#### 2. **Federal and State Breach Notification Laws for California**\n[2] The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires that if a data breach involves personal information, including SSNs or medical records, then notification must be provided to affected individuals within a specified timeframe. Additionally, the law mandates that any breach involving sensitive health information should also notify the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n#### 3. **Security Breach Notification Chart - California - Perkins Coie**\n[3] Under HIPAA, covered entities (such as healthcare providers) must comply with specific notice content requirements if they have breached protected health information (PHI). These requirements include providing a summary of the breach to affected individuals and notifying them about steps they can take to protect themselves from potential harm.\n\n#### 4. **California Medical Data Breach Notification Regulations**\n[4] California has updated its data breach reporting requirements for healthcare facilities, requiring all healthcare facilities in the state to comply with new regulations that apply in addition to federal HIPAA regulations. These updates include increased administrative penalties for breaches of sensitive patient data.\n\n### Penalties for Non-Compliance\n\n#### 5. **HIPAA Compliance and California Law**\n[5] The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates strict compliance with breach notification requirements, including providing timely notifications to affected individuals and the Secretary of HHS. Failure to comply can result in significant penalties.\n\n#### 6. **Data Breach Compliance Under the CCPA**\n[6] While the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) does not apply directly to data breaches involving",

      "answer_a": "To address the legal question regarding notification requirements for a data breach involving both Social Security Numbers (SSNs) and medical information in California, as well as penalties for non-compliance, we need to analyze the available resources.\n\n### Notification Requirements\n\nCalifornia has specific laws that govern data breaches. The primary law is the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which requires companies to notify affected individuals of a breach within 30 days if personal information is compromised. However, this does not specifically address medical information or SSNs.\n\nFor medical information and SSNs, the **California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA)** provides additional protections. CMIA mandates that healthcare providers must notify patients when there has been a breach involving Protected Health Information (PHI), which includes SSNs in some cases [1].\n\nIn California, if both personal information such as SSNs and medical information are compromised in a data breach, the notification requirements would likely be governed by both CCPA and CMIA. Therefore, companies should notify affected individuals within 30 days of discovering the breach under CCPA guidelines, but they must also comply with CMIA's specific provisions for notifying patients about breaches involving PHI.\n\n### Penalties for Non-Compliance\n\nPenalties for non-compliance can vary significantly depending on the severity and nature of the violation. The **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** imposes penalties for violations, including fines up to $7,500 per violation [2]. However, these penalties are typically applied in cases where there is a failure to comply with CCPA requirements.\n\nFor HIPAA violations, which often involve breaches of PHI, the **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)** imposes substantial penalties. These can include fines up to $1.5 million per violation [3]. Additionally, HIPAA requires companies to notify affected individuals within 60 days of discovering a breach involving PHI.\n\nIn cases where both CCPA and HIPAA are implicated, the more severe penalty would typically apply. For example, if there is a failure to comply with CMIA's notification requirements for breaches involving medical information, the company could face penalties under CMIA [4].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor a data breach involving both SSNs and medical information in California:\n- **Notification Requirements**: Companies must notify affected individuals within 30 days of discovering the breach under CCPA guidelines.
