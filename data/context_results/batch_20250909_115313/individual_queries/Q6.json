      "answer": "To address the federal lobbying registration and reporting requirements for a 501(c)(3) organization engaging in climate policy advocacy, we need to consider several key points based on the provided search results. Here is a comprehensive answer:\n\n### Federal Lobbying Registration and Reporting Requirements for a 501(c)(3) Organization\n\n#### 1. **Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA)**\nThe federal Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) requires entities that employ one or more in-house lobbyists to register with Congress [1]. This registration is necessary regardless of whether the organization engages in lobbying activities.\n\n#### 2. **Thresholds for Registration**\nUnder the LDA, an organization must register if it employs an individual who meets the definition of a \"lobbyist\" and if its total expenses or income for lobbying activities meet certain monetary thresholds [1]. The primary factors determining when an individual becomes a \"lobbyist\" include whether they regularly attempt to influence legislation.\n\n#### 3. **Lobbying Expenses**\nFor 501(c)(3) organizations, the IRS has specific guidelines regarding the amount of lobbying that can be engaged in annually. While there are no explicit monetary thresholds for 501(c)(3) organizations as such, they must ensure their lobbying activities do not make up a substantial part of their overall activities [8]. The LDA requires these organizations to report all lobbying expenses and contacts.\n\n#### 4. **Reporting Requirements**\n501(c)(3) organizations are required to file reports with the Office of the Clerk of the House, which is responsible for enforcing the Lobbying Disclosure Act [7]. These reports include detailed information about lobbying activities, including who was contacted, what issues were discussed, and the nature of the contact (e.g., personal or professional).\n\n#### 5. **Climate Policy Advocacy**\nFor climate policy advocacy specifically, organizations must ensure that their lobbying efforts are aligned with their charitable goals [3]. They should not spend too much time trying to change laws unrelated to their charitable objectives [4].\n\n### Relevant Statutes and Regulations\n\n- **Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA)**: The LDA requires registration of lobbyists and reporting of lobbying activities. It is enforced by the Office of the Clerk of the House.\n  - Source: [7]\n  \n- **Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 501(c)(3)**: This section governs the tax-exempt status of organizations like 5",

      "answer": "To address the federal lobbying registration and reporting requirements for a 501(c)(3) organization engaging in climate policy advocacy, we need to consider several factors based on the provided search results. \n\n### Registration Requirements\n\n[2] states that even if an employee meets the two-part test (i.e., spending more than $12,500 on lobbying activities), a 501(c)(3) organization does not have to register until it spends more than $12,500. This suggests that initial registration might be triggered by significant lobbying expenditures rather than mere engagement.\n\n[3] and [4] indicate that nonprofits may need to register with Congress if they meet certain criteria related to their lobbying activities under the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA).

However, IRC Section 204 imposes restrictions on lobbying activities by tax-exempt organizations. Specifically, IRC Section 204(a)(1) states that no part of the net earnings of a 501(c)(3) organization may inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.\n\n#### Climate Policy Advocacy and Lobbying\nClimate policy advocacy can be considered lobbying if it involves substantial interaction with legislators, regulatory agencies, or other government bodies. The key question is whether such activities are so closely related to the organization's exempt purposes that they do not violate IRC Section 204.\n\n### Specific Requirements for Climate Policy Advocacy\n\n#### Registration and Reporting\n1. **Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) Compliance**: A 501(c)(3) organization must comply with the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, which requires disclosure of lobbying activities to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO). This includes filing a Form L-1A for each lobbyist who spends more than $200 in any calendar month on behalf of the organization.\n\n2. **Annual Report**: The organization must file an annual report with the IRS, Form 990-T, which includes information about lobbying activities and expenditures related to such activities. This form is due by March 31 following the end of the tax year.\n\n#### Exempt Purposes\nClimate policy advocacy can be considered a charitable purpose under IRC Section 501(c)(3) if it aims at preventing or reducing environmental harm, promoting sustainable development, or advancing other public welfare goals related to climate change. However, any lobbying activities must not violate IRC Section 204.\n\n### Relevant Statutes and Case Law\n\n- **IRC Section 204**: This section outlines the restrictions on lobbying by tax-exempt organizations.\n- **Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA)**: The LDA requires disclosure of lobbying activities to ensure transparency in",

These requirements are governed by the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA), which imposes obligations on entities that lobby various federal officials once certain thresholds have been exceeded.\n\n#### Registration Requirements\n[1] According to [Title: PDF Lobbying Disclosure Act Thresholds 2025 Update - afj.org](https://afj.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lobbying-Disclosure-Act-Thresholds-2025-Update.pdf), the LDA applies to any entity that lobbies, including a 501(c)(3) organization. The LDA requires entities employing one or more in-house lobbyists to register with Congress. Both the employer and the in-house lobbyist are responsible for filing periodic disclosure reports.\n\n#### Reporting Requirements\n[2] [Title: Lobbying - Internal Revenue Service](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/lobbying) states that no organization may qualify for section 501(c)(3) status if a substantial part of its activities is attempting to influence legislation (commonly known as lobbying). A 501(c)(3) organization can engage in some lobbying, but too much lobbying activity risks losing tax-exempt status. Legislation includes action by Congress, any state legislature, any local council, or similar.\n\n[7] [Title: Rules of 501 (c) (3) Nonprofit Lobbying - NAEYC](https://www.naeyc.org/our-work/public-policy-advocacy/rules-501c3-nonprofit-lobbying) provides an overview of nonprofit lobbying definitions, rules, dos and don'ts. A 501(c)(3) organization is subject to heightened restrictions on lobbying activities; too much lobbying activity risks losing tax-exempt status.\n\n#### Thresholds for Registration\n[9] [Title: LDA's Registration Thresholds Increase for Lobbyist Employers and ...](https://www.insidepoliticallaw.com/2025/03/10/ldas-registration-thresholds-increase-for-lobbyist-employers-and-lobbying-firms/) indicates that under the federal Lobby",

      "answer_a": "To address the federal lobbying registration and reporting requirements for a 501(c)(3) organization engaging in climate policy advocacy, we need to consider several aspects of the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA), as well as other related laws. Here is a comprehensive overview based on the provided sources:\n\n### Registration Requirements\n\n[6] [7] indicate that 501(c)(3) organizations must comply with federal lobbying registration requirements under the LDA. Specifically, these organizations are required to register if they engage in lobbying activities and meet certain thresholds.\n\n- **Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA)**: The LDA requires nonprofits to register as lobbyists if their lobbying expenses exceed $5,000 per year or if they have more than 3 employees who perform lobbying services. [7] provides additional details on the registration process for public charities.\n  \n### Reporting Requirements\n\n[6], [7], and [8] highlight that once registered under the LDA, nonprofits must file quarterly electronic reports of their lobbying activities.\n\n- **Quarterly Reports**: These reports typically include information such as the names of lobbyists, the nature of lobbying activities, and expenses. [8] provides specific details on what needs to be reported.\n  \n### Climate Policy Advocacy\n\n[10] mentions that 501(c)(3) organizations may also need to register with Congress if their climate policy advocacy meets certain thresholds under federal laws.\n\n- **Federal Lobbying Disclosure Act**: Organizations engaging in significant lobbying activities related to climate policy might be required to comply with the LDA, even if they are not explicitly engaged in traditional lobbying. [10] provides guidance on these requirements for 501(c)(3) organizations.\n  \n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **State and Local Requirements**: While federal laws like the LDA apply broadly, state and local regulations may also impose additional reporting or registration requirements. For example, New York has specific lobbying disclosure requirements that nonprofits must adhere to [2].\n  \n- **Nonprofit Lobbying Guidelines**: Organizations should consult resources such as those provided by Independent Sector (e.g., [7]) for detailed guidance on compliance with federal laws and best practices.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nA 501(c)(3) organization engaging in climate policy advocacy would need to register under the LDA if their lobbying expenses exceed $5,000 per year or they have more than three employees performing such services.

      "answer_b": "To address the federal lobbying registration and reporting requirements for a 501(c)(3) organization engaging in climate policy advocacy, we need to consider several key points based on the provided search results. Here is a comprehensive answer:\n\n### Federal Lobbying Registration and Reporting Requirements for a 501(c)(3) Organization\n\n#### 1. **Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA)**\nThe federal Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) requires entities that employ one or more in-house lobbyists to register with Congress [1]. This registration is necessary regardless of whether the organization engages in lobbying activities.\n\n#### 2. **Thresholds for Registration**\nUnder the LDA, an organization must register if it employs an individual who meets the definition of a \"lobbyist\" and if its total expenses or income for lobbying activities meet certain monetary thresholds [1]. The primary factors determining when an individual becomes a \"lobbyist\" include whether they regularly attempt to influence legislation.\n\n#### 3. **Lobbying Expenses**\nFor 501(c)(3) organizations, the IRS has specific guidelines regarding the amount of lobbying that can be engaged in annually. While there are no explicit monetary thresholds for 501(c)(3) organizations as such, they must ensure their lobbying activities do not make up a substantial part of their overall activities [8]. The LDA requires these organizations to report all lobbying expenses and contacts.\n\n#### 4. **Reporting Requirements**\n501(c)(3) organizations are required to file reports with the Office of the Clerk of the House, which is responsible for enforcing the Lobbying Disclosure Act [7]. These reports include detailed information about lobbying activities, including who was contacted, what issues were discussed, and the nature of the contact (e.g., personal or professional).\n\n#### 5. **Climate Policy Advocacy**\nFor climate policy advocacy specifically, organizations must ensure that their lobbying efforts are aligned with their charitable goals [3]. They should not spend too much time trying to change laws unrelated to their charitable objectives [4].\n\n### Relevant Statutes and Regulations\n\n- **Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA)**: The LDA requires registration of lobbyists and reporting of lobbying activities.

This suggests that initial registration might be triggered by significant lobbying expenditures rather than mere engagement.\n\n[3] and [4] indicate that nonprofits may need to register with Congress if they meet certain criteria related to their lobbying activities under the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA). Specifically, a 501(c)(3) organization must report its lobbying activities in accordance with the LDA. \n\n### Reporting Requirements\n\n[2] mentions that organizations do not have to register until they spend more than $12,500 on lobbying activities. However, once registered, they are required to file quarterly electronic reports identifying their lobbyists and detailing their lobbying activities.\n\n[4] provides additional context by stating that a 501(c)(3) organization may engage in some lobbying but too much activity could jeopardize its tax-exempt status. This implies there is an upper limit on allowable lobbying expenditures for such organizations.\n\n### Specific to Climate Policy Advocacy\n\nWhile the search results do not provide specific information about climate policy advocacy, they generally align with the broader requirements of 501(c)(3) organizations engaging in any form of lobbying. \n\n[7] mentions that organizations with annual gross receipts under $50,000 are exempt from filing IRS Form 990-N (e-postcard), which means they do not have to report their lobbying activities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor a 501(c)(3) organization engaging in climate policy advocacy, the key points are:\n\n- Registration may be triggered by spending more than $12,500 on lobbying activities.\n- Once registered, quarterly electronic reports must be filed identifying lobbyists and detailing lobbying activities.\n- There is an upper limit to allowable lobbying expenditures for tax-exempt status.\n\nThese requirements apply regardless of the specific subject matter (e.g., climate policy) as long as the organization engages in lobbying. \n\nFor precise compliance with these requirements, it would be advisable to consult with legal counsel",

      "answer_a": "To address the federal lobbying registration and reporting requirements for a 501(c)(3) organization engaging in climate policy advocacy, we need to consider both the general rules governing lobbying activities by tax-exempt organizations and specific provisions related to climate policy.\n\n### Federal Lobbying Registration and Reporting Requirements\n\n#### General Rules Governing Lobbying Activities\nA 501(c)(3) organization is generally exempt from federal income taxes under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 501(c)(3). However, IRC Section 204 imposes restrictions on lobbying activities by tax-exempt organizations. Specifically, IRC Section 204(a)(1) states that no part of the net earnings of a 501(c)(3) organization may inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.\n\n#### Climate Policy Advocacy and Lobbying\nClimate policy advocacy can be considered lobbying if it involves substantial interaction with legislators, regulatory agencies, or other government bodies. The key question is whether such activities are so closely related to the organization's exempt purposes that they do not violate IRC Section 204.\n\n### Specific Requirements for Climate Policy Advocacy\n\n#### Registration and Reporting\n1. **Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) Compliance**: A 501(c)(3) organization must comply with the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, which requires disclosure of lobbying activities to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO). This includes filing a Form L-1A for each lobbyist who spends more than $200 in any calendar month on behalf of the organization.\n\n2. **Annual Report**: The organization must file an annual report with the IRS, Form 990-T, which includes information about lobbying activities and expenditures related to such activities. This form is due by March 31 following the end of the tax year.\n\n#### Exempt Purposes\nClimate policy advocacy can be considered a charitable purpose under IRC Section 501(c)(3) if it aims at preventing or reducing environmental harm, promoting sustainable development, or advancing other public welfare goals related to climate change. However, any lobbying activities must not violate IRC Section 204.\n\n### Relevant Statutes and Case Law\n\n- **IRC Section 204**: This section outlines the restrictions on lobbying by tax-exempt organizations.\n- **Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA)**: The LDA requires disclosure of lobbying activities to ensure transparency in",
